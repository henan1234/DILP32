Gravitation screen saver
------------------------
This is a screen saver simulating the universal gravitation among stars, planets and asteroids.
It use real gravitation formulae because you cannot obtain stable star system without it. 
And it is fun to fine tune and experiment.

Installation :
------------
The supplied EXE file decompressed the "Gravitation.scr" file into your system directory ( like other screen savers ).
You can choose it by opening your desktop properties ( screen saver tab ).

You can fine tune the program in the settings window.

Know bugs :
---------
This program is realy stable as i don't do any dynamic memory allocation. It runned several times for a entire week end long without any bug.
Displaying ruler lines can hang some machine, this functionnality is DISABLED in this version.
So, no known problem.

This program is also available in french language.

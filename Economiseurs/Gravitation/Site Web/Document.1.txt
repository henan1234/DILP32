May be you want to add my shareware screen saver on you site:

Gravitation is a screen saver that uses real gravity equations to move stars and planets on your screen.
Initial star systems can be randomly created or can be created from a configuration file.
Ray traced planets make it look very nice.
The program let you customize your universe with lots of parameters.

The 5.0 version brings you:
-new optimization
-enhanced graphics
-skin files let shareware and registered users customize the overall look. Two sample skin files are included.

<p><small>The escape velocity is the minimum velocity for an object to move away from a
planet without being caught in its attraction field. The planet will pull back the object
but never enough to make it go back to the planet.</small></p>

<p><small>When a planet goes away from the screen, the program computes its escape
velocity from the heaviest planet (or star) of the star system. If the current velocity is
bigger than the specified percentage of the escape velocity, the planet is considered as
lost in space and removed from the star system.</small></p>

<p><small>Setting a big percentage of the escape velocity will allow the planets to go
more far from the screen, but they will take a very long time to come back.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small>If one is very smaller than the other, it is absorbed by the biggest planet</small></li>
  <li><small>If the two planets have similar sizes, what happens depend on their relative
    speed:</small><ul>
      <li><small>If their relative speed is high, they explode, creating multiple fragment
        (smaller planets).</small></li>
      <li><small>If their relative speed is low, they melt to create a new planet.</small></li>

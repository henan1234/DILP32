<A NAME="Principle"></A>Principle</H2>
The principle is very simple: You just add a transparent layer on you screen
( in front or behind your windows ).
<BR>You simply draw what you want on the layer using your favorite image
editor ( if you don't have one, just use the standard Windows Paint program
).

<P>You can have as many layers ( or pages ) as you want, depending only
on how many disk space you want to use.
<BR>You can protect your notes with a password, even can you have a different
password for each page.
<H2>

Launch "TransparentDesktop.exe"</LI>

<LI>
It is a good idea to add a shortcut to "TransparentDesktop.exe" to your
Startup directory if it has not be made by the install program, so Transparent
Desktop will be automatically launched every time you start Windows. If
you installed the program with the setup program, the shortcut has been
automatically created for you.</LI>

The first thing you need to know is that you will edit your notes with
your favorite image editor. You can change this editor in the <A HREF="#Configuration">Configuration
Window</A>.
<BR>You can draw whatever you want on the page.
<BR>Just follow one rule: Whatever you will draw in black will be the transparent
part of the layer.
<BR>Don't forget to save your work before exiting the image editor. You
must save the file without changing its name or format ( use "Save", not
"Save As" ). You can anyway change the color depth of your image, read
the 256 colors mode problem.
<BR>When you exit from the image editor, Transparent Desktop will scan
your new notes.

<H4>
<A NAME="Optimizing your notes"></A>Optimizing your notes</H4>
YES, you can use <B>any </B>note shape you want ( i promised it ) !
<BR>BUT ! Some shapes are better than others. If you want Transparent Desktop
Window to use less memory and Windows to run quicker, you can use optimizable
shapes. This shapes should be made of rectangles :
<BR><IMG SRC="Note1.gif" HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=169><IMG SRC="Note4.gif" HEIGHT=231 WIDTH=268><IMG SRC="Note3.gif" HEIGHT=231 WIDTH=268><IMG SRC="Note5.gif" HEIGHT=135 WIDTH=268>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Note2.gif" HEIGHT=231 WIDTH=268>
<BR>Unoptimizable shapes work fine, but they cause Transparent Desktop
to generate many rectangles, so it occupies more memory space and can slow
down Windows. Experiment, if you have a fast PC with plenty of memory,
you may not notice any difference.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="50%">
<H4>
<A NAME="The 256 colors mode"></A>The 256 colors mode problem</H4>
Microsoft never make programmer's work easy. Sometimes, even not easy for
the end user. The 256 colors mode is a very weird mode, because, you don't
really 256 system colors. You just have 16 like the 16 color mode. Only
the foreground application can ask for 256 colors. And the Transparent
Desktop is made to work in background, so if it use its 256 colors, how
will your foreground text processing application look ? So, you will have
to try. If your screen displays 256 colors, you can try to translate your
notes page to 16 colors.&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="50%">
<H4>
<A NAME="The 64K colors problem"></A>The 64K colors problem</H4>
If your screen displays 64k colors, you may encounter problems when editing
the page generated by Transparent Desktop with an application like Paint
Shop Pro. This is a known bug. The solution is simple : when you add a
new page, <A HREF="#Default image editor">edit it with Microsoft Paint</A>
for the first time, save it. You will now be able to edit it with any image
editor.

<BR>Shareware programs are to be used only for tests. You can freely use
them and distribute them. If you decide to use it, you must obtain the
